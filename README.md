Understanding the business objective:

Our first goal is to understand a business objective if one is provided.

The kaggle data card stipulates that this dataset was generated programmatically using python, and is meant to be used as a learning resource

Key Take-aways:

1.Synthetic data with no customer or business information

2.Dataset follows a probabilistic uplift model

Probabilistic Uplift Model:

I had no prior experience on this model and toook it upon myself to research it before proceeding with the dataset.

Probabilistic Modeling is a statistical approcah used to predict the probability of various outcomes.

Instead of simply predicting the probability of an outcome upllift models predict how intervention is like to affect the probability of an outcome.

It does this by comparing the outcome of two hypothetical scenarios for a desired outcome.

For example: You want to puechase product A. Uplif modeling comapres a scenario where treatment was recieved with a scenario where treatment was not received.

-Its Application is prominent in the following fields:

 1. Marketing
 2. Healthcare
 3. Politics
 4. Huuman Resources
